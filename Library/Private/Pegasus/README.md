# Pegasus

Pegasus is a private foundation library for one of [RecordCollection](../../../Service/RecordCollection/README.md)
implementations. It's optimized for small scale usage and allows users to change internal constants using
[PegasusConstants](./Constants/README.md) internal service. Also, Pegasus
uses [MemoryPool](../../../Service/MemoryPool/README.md) to store objects.
