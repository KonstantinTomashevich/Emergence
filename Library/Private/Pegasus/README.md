# Pegasus

Pegasus is a private foundation library for one of the [RecordCollection](../../../Service/RecordCollection/README.md)
implementations. It's optimized for small scale usage and allows users to change internal constants using
[PegasusConstants](./Constants/README.md) internal service. Also, Pegasus uses `OrderedPool` from
[Memory](../../../Service/Memory/README.md) to store objects.
