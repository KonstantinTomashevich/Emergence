# Galleon

Galleon is a private foundation library for one of [Warehouse](../../../Service/Warehouse/README.md) implementations. It
uses [RecordCollection](../../../Service/RecordCollection/README.md) service as backend for parametric queries execution
and as storage for types, that require these queries.
