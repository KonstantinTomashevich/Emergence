# Galleon

Galleon is a private foundation library for one of the [Warehouse](../../../Service/Warehouse/README.md)
implementations. It uses [RecordCollection](../../../Service/RecordCollection/README.md) service as backend for
parametric queries execution and as storage for types, that require these queries.
