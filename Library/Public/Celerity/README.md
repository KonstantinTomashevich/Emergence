# Celerity

It is an ECS-like framework for game world logic development, based on
[Warehouse](../../../Service/Warehouse/README.md), [Flow](../Flow/README.md)
and [TaskExecutor](../../../Service/TaskExecutor/README.md).
Celerity has several extensions: see [library-style extensions](./Extension)
and [service-style extensions](../../../Service/Celerity/Extension).
