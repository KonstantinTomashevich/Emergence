# Celerity: UI extension

Provides native way for setting up UI viewports with windows and simplistic controls. Uses 
[Input extension](../../../../Library/Public/Celerity/Extension/Input/README.md) to pass user input from UI to
game logic. [RenderFoundation](../../../../Library/Public/Celerity/Extension/RenderFoundation/README.md) is used
to render the UI geometry.
