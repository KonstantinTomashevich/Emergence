# Celerity<sup>Concrete</sup>

This unit provides an ECS-like framework for game world logic development, based on [Warehouse](../Warehouse/README.md),
[Flow](../Flow/README.md) and [TaskExecutor](../TaskExecutor/README.md). Celerity provides a lot of optional features
through units with `Celerity` prefix in their name.
